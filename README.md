# Linear-algebra-toolkit
linear-algebra-toolkit is an interface for performing matrix calculations in C++. It can be used to manage and solve systems of equations with simple function calls.

This implementation is an exercise in object-oriented programming and computational mathematics, thus the goal with all of code is to emphasize OOP concepts and fast algorithms.
